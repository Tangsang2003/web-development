# The UNIX command line
- The `~` denotes that we are in our `Users` directory.
## Basic UNIX commands
- We can use `pwd` to get our current working directory.
- The `ls` command lists all the files and folders in the directory we are currently in.
- The `ls -a` command lists all the files including the hidden files as well.
- The `cd` command can be used to change our current directory.
- We can hold `alt` to move to a position with the mouse. Usually done when we have to edit a very long command.
- `CTRL + A` to move to the beginning of the command and `CTRL + E` to move to the end of the command.
- `CTRL + U` to clear command. We should be at the end of the command though.
- The `mkdir` command is used to make a new directory.
- The `touch` command is used to make a new file.
- To open a file: 
  - In MAC, we use `open.`
  - In windows, we use `start.`
- Also, to specify with which application to open a file, we use:
  - `open -a APPLICATION_NAME FILE_NAME`
  - In windows, `start -a APPLICATION_NAME FILE_NAME`
    - The `start` command starts `cmd`. So, to open without cmd, we can directly use `code FILE_NAME` or `APPLICATION_NAME FILE_NAME`.
- We can use `rm FILE_NAME` to remove or delete a file.
- We can use `rm *` to delete every files in the working directory.
- To remove folders or directories, we need to use the flag `-r` like: 
  - `rm -r DIRECTORY__NAME` .
  - `rm -rf DIRECTORY__NAME` is forced delete, i.e. doesn't ask for CONFIRMATION.
