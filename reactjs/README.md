What is React?
- A javaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Breaking down apps to components that are reusable and customizable.
- It's like defining our own HTML components, defining its functions, properties, etc.
- React combines small ammounts of html, css, js into a single component.
- Components can listen to changes and update themselves without affecting other components.

## 15.1 Introduction to JSX and Babel
- `<div id="root"></div>` is always used in all React apps.
  - Inside this is where we put everything we create in React.
- JSX helps in writing plain HTML directly in javaScript file.
- Babel is a javaScript compiler.
- Babel converts any next generation javaScript code to a form/vanilla javaScript, that is understandable by all the browsers.
- The starter code for any react app can be found [here.](./JSX-and-Babel/)
